Notes:
I'm going to continue working on the optionals until I hit this week's deadline. I couldn't get the buttons on the 4th screen of the walk-through to segue to the signup/signin flows for my swipes implementation. Seemed like this should have been the easy part of that exercise, but I got totally stuck. Would love an extra set of eyes to help me understand was I was doing wrong.
